Dear Students,

Starting from Thursday, March 24th, 2022, the course weekly schedule is as follows:

   Supplementary lecture, presented by Dr. Chaim Baskin or Prof. Alex Bronstein.

Notes:
- The Sunday/Tuesday tutorial groups start from the **second** week of the
  semester, so that it comes after each week's lecture.
- The primary lecture material is covered by Alex's videos. Weekly
  video-viewing schedule is defined in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
  _pages/info.md %}#detailed-syllabus). Make sure to watch the relevant video
  lecture each week **before** class.
- The in-class lectures provide supplementary material. They will (usually) be
  1-hour long and aim to present more advanced topics and new research in the
  field.
- To support international students, all course materials, including lecture
  and tutorial videos, are provided in English.

We wish you a productive semester and hope you enjoy the course!


Good luck,  
Aviv & course staff.
