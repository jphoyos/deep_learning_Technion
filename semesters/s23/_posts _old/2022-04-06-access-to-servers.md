Dear Students,

Those of you who registered for access to the course servers should now have access.
Please read the [usage instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_assignments/01-hpc-servers.md %}) carefully.

Also, please note that if you have issues using the Technion VPN, please
contact [CIS support](https://cis.technion.ac.il/support/) directly, as we cannot assist you with that.

Good luck,  
Aviv
