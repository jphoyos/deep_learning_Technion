Dear Students,

We have opened a Piazza forum for your benefit.
This will serve as the **only official** discussion forum for our course.

You can sign up and access Piazza
[here](https://piazza.com/technion.ac.il/spring2022/236781), by signing up with your
Technion `@campus` email. External (non-Technion) students can also access
Piazza by invitation. Such students can send me an email and request an invite
for Piazza.

All questions regarding course material and homework **must** be posted on the
Piazza forum. Please refrain from using email for this purpose. This way all
students can benefit collectively from the answers we post.

We also encourage you to read the [welcome
post](https://piazza.com/class/l0ns393e5l22ik?cid=6) and find out how you can
get a bonus grade by using Piazza!

Thanks and enjoy,<br>
Aviv & Course staff.
