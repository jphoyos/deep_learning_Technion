## Project-related office hours

Please use the piazza as always.
This assignment is a bit diffrent, as your code would not be wrapped in anyway,
 means you need to learn how to download annotations, tools and models by yourself.
**Try** to solve things by yourself first, and then you can contact Efrat, Evgenii or Moshe for help.

Enjoy and good luck!
