Dear students,


The project final submission is pospone till 30.3 due to the cyber attack.

The course server is working only from the technion, but as i advised before, most of the work can be done locally on your computer or on google colab.


HW2 graded as well, and the grades will be uploaded shortly

good luck
The course staff
