Dear students,

from your requests we've started to upload recorded tutorials in hebrew as well (currently only tutorial 3 and 4 avalible)

The sound is not great and we will try to improve it in the future.

As for all the cancelations and complementry tutorials:

Untill the end of this week, all you need to attend to/watch is up to tutorial 5

Tutorial 6 is the last one that relate to the second homework assignment and only as a small part, so you can start and work on it already.


Best regards,  
The course staff.
